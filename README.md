## Adding Recipes

Recipes are managed in `src/data/recipes.ts`. To add a new recipe:

1. Create a new recipe object following the `Recipe` interface
2. Add it to the `recipes` array
3. The site will automatically generate a page at `/recipe/your-recipe-id`

Example recipe structure:
```typescript
{
  id: 'your-recipe-id',
  title: 'Recipe Title',
  author: 'Author Name',
  createdDate: '2024-01-01',
  lastUpdatedDate: '2024-01-15', // optional
  tags: ['category1', 'category2'],
  ingredients: [
    { name: 'flour', amount: 2, unit: 'cups' },
    // ...
  ],
  prepInstructions: ['Step 1', 'Step 2'],
  cookingInstructions: ['Step 1', 'Step 2'],
  prepTimeMinutes: 15,
  cookTimeMinutes: 30,
  servings: 4
}
```

## Philosophy

Simple Recipes was created as an antidote to modern recipe blogs that bury the actual recipe under endless stories and ads. We believe:

- Recipes should be easy to find and follow
- Accessibility shouldn't be an afterthought
- Fast loading matters more than flashy animations
- Privacy is important - no tracking or data collection
- Clean code makes for maintainable sites
