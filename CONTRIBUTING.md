## Recipe Format Guidelines

When adding new recipes, follow this structure:

```typescript
export interface Recipe {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  tags: string[];
  author: string;
  createdDate: string;
  lastUpdatedDate?: string;
  ingredients: Ingredient[];
  prepInstructions: string[];
  cookingInstructions: string[];
  additionalNotes?: string;
  prepTimeMinutes: number;
  cookTimeMinutes: number;
  servings: number;
}
```

This is an example of a recipe in TypeScript:

```typescript
{
    id: 'classic-chocolate-chip-cookies',
    title: 'Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies',
    tags: ['dessert', 'cookies', 'quick'],
    author: 'Sarah Baker',
    createdDate: '2024-01-15',
    lastUpdatedDate: '2024-02-10',
    ingredients: [
      { name: 'all-purpose flour', amount: 2.25, unit: 'cups' },
      { name: 'baking soda', amount: 1, unit: 'tsp' },
      { name: 'salt', amount: 1, unit: 'tsp' },
      { name: 'butter', amount: 1, unit: 'cup', notes: 'softened' },
      { name: 'granulated sugar', amount: 0.75, unit: 'cup' },
      { name: 'brown sugar', amount: 0.75, unit: 'cup', notes: 'packed' },
      { name: 'eggs', amount: 2, unit: 'whole', notes: 'large' },
      { name: 'vanilla extract', amount: 2, unit: 'tsp' },
      { name: 'chocolate chips', amount: 2, unit: 'cups' }
    ],
    prepInstructions: [
      'Preheat oven to 375Â°F (190Â°C).',
      'In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.',
      'In a large bowl, cream together softened butter and both sugars until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.',
      'Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla extract.',
      'Gradually mix in the flour mixture until just combined.',
      'Fold in chocolate chips.'
    ],
    cookingInstructions: [
      'Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.',
      'Bake for 9-11 minutes or until edges are golden brown.',
      'Cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.'
    ],
    additionalNotes: 'For chewier cookies, slightly underbake them. For crispier cookies, bake for an additional 1-2 minutes.',
    prepTimeMinutes: 15,
    cookTimeMinutes: 11,
    servings: 48
}
```

If you look at this example, you'll see:

- There's no description of the recipe
- The additional notes are optional. Don't abuse this by putting in a story or fluff. Keep it focused on the recipe
- Ingredients are encoded this way so they can be converted between metric and imperial units
- Include both FÂº and CÂº in the recipe

## Getting Help

- Check existing documentation and issues first
- Ask questions in GitHub Discussions
- Be specific about what you're trying to achieve
