          Our Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          I believe cooking should be simple, accessible, and focused on what
          really matters: great food. That's why Simple Recipes exists without
          the endless blog posts, life stories, or pop-up ads that plague modern
          recipe sites. I just can't stand that.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          This is not a business or a money-making venture. This is a labor of
          love and an attempt to push back against the enshittification of the
          internet. More and more, the the internet is being choked out by ads,
          video ads, pop-ups, pop-overs, and interactivity that crashes the
          website. You just want to look up a recipe but can't even find the
          list of ingredients.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">Enough is enough.</p>

          Accessibility First
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Every recipe on Simple Recipes is designed to be accessible to
          everyone. I use semantic HTML, proper ARIA labels, and ensure full
          keyboard navigation support. The color choices meet WCAG accessibility
          guidelines, and I plan to test with screen readers to ensure a great
          experience for visually impaired users.

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">The Tech</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          I've built this site using <a
            href="https://astro.build/"
            target="_blank">Astro.js</a
          >, a fast, modern, and extensible framework for building websites.
          I've also used <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank"
            >Tailwind CSS</a
          > for styling, and <a href="https://vite.dev/" target="_blank">Vite</a
          > for building and bundling. Astro.js is a static site generator that allows
          us to build fast, performant websites with ease meaning there's less JavaScript
          and less load and less bloat. It also means the site is more accessible
          and more secure.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The initial site and some of the boilerplate was built using Claude
          Code.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Interactivity is cool...can be cool...but not if it takes down your
          computer loading a website while you're looking for a recipe for mac
          and cheese. So I don't have any of that crap here.
