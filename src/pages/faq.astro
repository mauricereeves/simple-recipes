        <p class="mt-2">
          My name is Mo. I'm a software engineer and middling cook. I created
          Simple Recipes to make cooking simple and accessible for everyone. I
          like looking up and trying new recipes and most sites are garbage and
          upset me. I just want something simple, fast, and easy to use.

          So you're not a chef?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">Nope. Just someone who likes to cook.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">
          What do you mean by "cook with your heart?"
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Recipes are a starting point, a guide, a way to learn how to make a
          dish, but they're not (usually) set in stone. You can and should feel
          comfortable adjusting recipes to suit your needs, dietary
          restrictions, and preferred flavors. If you want more cheese, add more
          cheese. If you want to make it spicy, make it spicy. This food is for
          you, so make it for you. Follow your heart.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Also...just so we're clear, I am not big on rules generally. I don't
          believe there's any restrictions on what you eat when. If you want to
          eat fried rice for breakfast, then you should do that. I love fried
          rice for breakfast. Pancakes for dinner? Yum. Nobody sets the rules
          for what's appropriate for when but you.

          Can I submit a recipe?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Absolutely! Send it to <a
            href="mailto:submissions@simple-recipes.me"
            class="hover:text-blue-600 focus:text-blue-600 focus:outline-none focus:underline"
            >submissions@simple-recipes.me</a
          >. I'll give it a try (probably) and then add it, though I can't make
          any promises about how quickly that will happen. If I add it, I'll let
          you know when it goes up on the website.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">
          What do you mean you'll "probably" try it?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          If it's a pretty straightforward recipe, I might just add it. If it's
          something I'm not super familiar with, I'll probably try it out with
          just to make sure that it's good, or at least workable. I know that
          not everything will be to my liking, but others might enjoy it.

          What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Honestly, there's very little that I find weird, but I did have fish
          aspic in France once and it was...not something I enjoyed. But I'd
          probably try it again given the chance.

          Did you vibe code this?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Yes, here and there. I am a software engineer who likes to code, but I
          absolutely used Claude Code to build out some boilerplate at the
          beginning.

          What's with the accessibility?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          People of all kinds of abilities and capabilities use the internet and
          we should make sure that as many people as possible find it easy and
          straightforward to use. Everyone should have access to the internet
          and the information it contains.

          What's with all the vegetarian and vegan recipes?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Get over it. People eat all kinds of different ways and vegetables are
          amazing. You should probably enjoy them more often.
